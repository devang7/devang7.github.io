### About Me

Hi! I am Devang. I love working on data-intensive distributed technologies - streaming, storing and ETL-ing. 
Being an advocate of the open source world, I am passionate about contributing in teams to built great software products. 

In my free time, I play tennis, soccer and blog about things that I keep exploring.

Currently, I am working at LinkedIn.
